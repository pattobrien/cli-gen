## Motivation

The ability to quickly whip up a command line script or application is a powerful skill for a developer to have. Compared to the Dart language itself, which offers a tremendous developer experience when building all kinds of apps, cli-based libraries like `package:args` leave something to be desired when it comes to easily building and maintaining application logic.

`cli-gen` aims to offer quality-of-life improvements for building and maintaining CLI apps, by allowing you to generate command line APIs from plain Dart functions. It achives this by providing the following features:

- parsing String arguments to any Dart type
- `--help` text inference from Method declarations, doc comments, and default values
- proper error handling, without printing stack traces to the console

`cli-gen` was designed to make writing CLI applications as intuitive as writing any other piece of Dart code.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add `cli_annotations` to your `pubspec` dependencies and `cli_gen` and `build_runner` as dev dependencies.

```yaml
name: dart_git
description: An implementation of the git CLI in Dart.

environment:
  sdk: ^3.0.0

dependencies:
  cli_annotations: ^0.1.0-dev.4

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^2.4.8
  cli_gen: ^0.1.0-dev.4

# define an executable name (optional)
executables:
  dart_git: main
```

You can optionally define an executable name and activate it using [pub global activate](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#activating-a-package-on-your-local-machine).

### Run Build Runner

Once dependencies are installed, start the `build_runner` to begin code generation.

```bash
 $ dart run build_runner watch -d
```

### Define the Command Runner

Create a `CommandRunner` by annotating a class with `@cliRunner` and extending the generated superclass (using the usual `_$` prefix).

The generated code contains a single `CommandRunner.run()` method, which is the entry point for your CLI application, to be called from the `main` function.

```dart
@cliRunner
class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
  // ...
}
```

### Define a Command

Inside the `CommandRunner` class, create a `Command` by creating a method and annotating it with `@cliCommand`. See the [Features](#features) section for more information on the supported types and features.

```dart
@cliRunner
class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
  @cliCommand
  Future<void> merge({
    required String branch,
    MergeStrategy strategy = MergeStrategy.ort,
    bool? commit,
  }) async {
    // ... `git merge` logic ...
  }
}
```

You can create as many commands inside the `CommandRunner` class as you'd like:

```dart
@cliRunner
class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
  @cliCommand
  Future<void> merge({
    required String branch,
    MergeStrategy strategy = MergeStrategy.ort,
    bool? commit,
  }) async { /* ... */ }

  @cliCommand
  Future<void> stashPush() async { /* ... */ }

  @cliCommand
  Future<void> stashPop() async { /* ... */ }

  // ...
}
```

### Define a Subcommand

As your application grows, you may want to separate your commands into their own groups.

To do so, create a `Subcommand` class by annotating the class with `@cliSubcommand` and extending the generated superclass.

```dart
@cliSubcommand
class StashSubcommand extends _$StashSubcommand {
  @cliCommand
  Future<void> push() async { /* ... */ }

  @cliCommand
  Future<void> pop() async { /* ... */ }
}

```

Subcommands can then be connected to the main `CommandRunner` class, or to another `Subcommand` class, by using the `@cliMount` annotation.

```dart
@cliRunner
class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
  @cliMount
  StashSubcommand get stash => StashSubcommand();
}
```

### Run the Application

Finally, create a `main` function that calls the `run` method on your `CommandRunner`.

```dart
void main(List<String> arguments) async {
  final runner = GitRunner();
  await runner.run(arguments);
}
```

Your application is ready to go! ðŸŽ‰

Run a command to test out the generated help text and see the argument parsing in action.

```bash
# activate the executable (if executable is defined in `pubspec.yaml`)
$ dart pub global activate . --source=path

# run the application
$ dart_git merge --help
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
$ dart_git merge --help
Join two or more development histories together.

Usage: git-runner merge [arguments]
--branch (mandatory)
--commit
--options

Run "git-runner help" to see global options.
```

## Features

### Type-Safe Argument Parsing

`cli-gen` automatically parses incoming string arguments into the correct type, and automatically informs your user if they've entered an invalid value.

#### Supported Types

You can define your command methods with any Dart primitive type or enum, and `cli-gen` will **automatically** parse the incoming string arguments into the correct type.

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand({
  // Use any supported type, nullable or not
  Uri? outputFile,

  // Enums can automatically be parsed from strings
  MergeStrategy? strategy,

  // Custom types can also be used, but require passing your own
  // String parser to the `@Option` annotation
  @Option(parser: Email.fromString) Email? email,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

<blockquote>
NOTE: Types that can be automatically parsed are: String, int, double, bool, num, Uri, BigInt, and DateTime
</blockquote>

#### Collection Types

The Collection types `List`, `Set`, and `Iterable` are also supported, and can be used in combination with any of the above supported types.

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand({
  List<Uri>? inputFiles,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

### Help Text Inference (--help)

CLI applications typically provide a `--help` option that displays a list of available commands and descriptions of their parameters, to help users understand how they can interact with the application.

Rather than manually manitaining these details yourself, `cli-gen` automatically generates help text from your annotated methods, based on the method and parameter names, doc comments, default values, and whether each parameter is required or not.

#### Parameter Help Text

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand({
  // Required parameters will be shown to the user as `mandatory`
  required String requiredParam,

  // Optional and/or nullable parameters are not `mandatory`
  int? optionalParam,

  // Default values are also shown in the help text
  String defaultPath = '~/',

  // Use doc comments (i.e. 3 slashes) to display a description of the parameter
  /// A parameter that uses a doc comment
  String someDocumentedParameter,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

The above Dart function will generate a cli command with the following help text:

```bash
$ my-custom-command --help
Save your local modifications to a new stash.

Usage: git stash my-custom-command [arguments]
-h, --help                         Print this usage information.
    --required-param (mandatory)
    --optional-param
    --default-path                 (defaults to "~/")
    --some-documented-parameter    A parameter that uses a doc comment

Run "git help" to see global options.
```

#### Command Descriptions

You can also generate descriptions for your commands and the entire application by using doc comments on the annotated classes and methods.

```dart
/// A dart implementation of the git CLI.
@cliRunner
class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {

  /// Merge two or more development histories together.
  @cliCommand
  Future<void> commit() async {
    // ...
  }
}
```

will generate:

```bash
$ git-runner --help
A dart implementation of the git CLI.

Usage: git-runner [arguments]
-h, --help    Print this usage information.

Available commands:
  commit    Merge two or more development histories together.

Run "git help" to see global options.
```

#### Enums and Allowed Values

Enums are unique in that they inherently define a finite set of allowable values. `cli-gen` can use that information to generate a list of allowed values in the help text.

```dart
enum Values { a, b, c }
```

Using the above `Values` enum as a parameter to a `cliCommand` will generate the following help text:

```bash
--values (allowed: a, b, c)
```

If you ever need to override the default allowed values, you can do so by providing a list of values to the `allowed` parameter of the `@Option` annotation.

### Name Formatting

`cli-gen` translates Dart class, method and parameter names to kebab-case, which is the convention for CLI commands and flags.

For example, a method named `stashChanges` will be translated to `stash-changes`, and a parameter named `outputFile` will be translated to `--output-file`.

To override the default behavior, simply provide a `name` to the respective annotation (supported for `@cliCommand`, `@cliSubcommand`, `@cliRunner`, and `@Option`).

### Named and Positional Parameters

`cli_gen` can handle parameters no matter if they're positional or named; you're free to mix and match as you see fit:

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand(
  int? positionalParam, {
  String? namedParam,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

## Under the Hood

`cli-gen` generates code that uses `package:args` classes and utilities to manage command hierarchies and help text generation. The annotations included with this package are a 1:1 mapping to similar or identical concepts included with `package:args`, for example:

- `@cliRunner`
  - generates a `CommandRunner` class
  - has a `run` method that should be passed args and run from your `main` function
  - mounts any nested commands as subcommands via `CommandRunner.addCommand`
- `@cliCommand`
  - generates a `Command` class
  - overrides the `run` method with a call to your method or function
- `@cliSubcommand`
  - generates a `Command` class
  - adds all nested commands as subcommands via `Command.addSubcommand`

Examples of generated code can be found in the `example` project, within their respective `.g.dart` files.

## Design Goals

TODO: a little blurb about the project goals (incl. what `cli-gen` is and what it is not).

## Inspiration

Several projects were researched as references of CLI ergonomics and macro libraries, including:

- [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) - a declarative CLI parser for Rust
