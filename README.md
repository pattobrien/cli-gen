Build CLI applications from plain Dart classes and functions.

## Motivation

The ability to quickly whip up a command line script or application is a powerful skill for a developer to have. Unlike the Dart language itself, which offers a tremendous developer experience when building many kinds of apps, cli-based Dart libraries like `package:args` leave a lot to desire when it comes to getting up and running quickly, and being able to focus on building application logic instead of parsing and managing dynamic string data.

`cli-gen` aims to offer quality-of-life improvements for building and maintaining CLI apps, by allowing you to generate command line APIs from plain Dart functions. It does so by providing the following features:

- type-safe arguments via generated string parsing
- `help` text generation from param names, doc comments, and default values
- proper error handling, without printing stack traces to the console

`cli-gen` was designed to make writing CLI applications as intuitive as writing any other piece of Dart code, by abstracting away the underlying `package:args` semantics while providing access to the underlying details, if ever necessary.

## Quick Start

1. Add `cli_annotations` to your `pubspec` dependencies and `cli_gen` and `build_runner` as dev dependencies.

   ```yaml
   name: dart_git
   description: An implementation of the git CLI in Dart.

   environment:
     sdk: ^3.0.0

   dependencies:
     cli_annotations: ^0.1.0-dev.1

   dev_dependencies:
    build_runner: ^2.4.8
     cli_gen: ^0.1.0-dev.1

   # define an executable name (optional)
   executables:
     dart_git:
       path: main # file name of `main()` in bin/ directory
   ```

   You can optionally define an executable name and activate it using [pub global activate](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd/pub-global#activating-a-package-on-your-local-machine).

   Once dependencies are installed, start the `build_runner` to begin code generation.

   ```bash
    $ dart run build_runner watch -d
   ```

2. Create a `CommandRunner` by annotating a class with `@cliRunner` and extending the generated superclass (uses the typical `_$` prefix).

   The generated code contains a single `CommandRunner.run()` method, which is the entry point for your CLI application and will be called from the `main` function.

   ```dart
   @cliRunner
   class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
     // ...
   }
   ```

3. Create a `Command` by simply creating a method on the class. Any primative type or enum will be automatically parsed from incoming string arguments.

   ```dart
   @cliRunner
   class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
     @cliCommand
     Future<void> merge({
       required String branch,
       MergeStrategy strategy = MergeStrategy.ort,
       bool? commit,
     }) async {
       // ... application logic ...
     }
   }
   ```

4. As your application grows, you'll begin to want to separate your commands into their own groups.

   You can create a `Subcommand` by annotating a class with `@cliSubcommand` and extending the generated superclass.

   ```dart
   // Create your subcommand
   @cliSubcommand
   class StashSubcommand extends _$StashSubcommand {
     @cliCommand
     Future<void> push() async { /* ... */ }

     @cliCommand
     Future<void> pop() async { /* ... */ }
   }

   // Then mount it to your `CommandRunner` or a parent `Subcommand`
   @cliRunner
   class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {
     @mount
     Command get stash => StashSubcommand();
   }
   ```

5. Finally, create a `main` function that calls `run` on your `CommandRunner`.

   ```dart
   void main(List<String> arguments) async {
     final runner = GitRunner();
     await runner.run(arguments);
   }
   ```

Your application is ready to go! Run a command to test out the generated help text and see the argument parsing in action.

```bash
# activate the executable (if executable is defined in `pubspec.yaml`)
$ dart pub global activate . --source=path

# run the application
$ dart_git merge --help
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
$ dart_git merge --help
Join two or more development histories together.

Usage: git-runner merge [arguments]
--branch (mandatory)
--commit
--options

Run "git-runner help" to see global options.
```

## Under the Hood

`cli-gen` generates code that uses `package:args` classes and utilities to manage command hierarchies and help text generation. The annotations included with this package are a 1:1 mapping to similar or identical concepts included with `package:args`, for example:

- `@cliRunner`
  - generates a `CommandRunner` class
  - has a `run` method that should be passed args and run from your `main` function
  - mounts any nested commands as subcommands via `CommandRunner.addCommand`
- `@cliCommand`
  - generates a `Command` class
  - overrides the `run` method with a call to your method or function
- `@cliSubcommand`
  - generates a `Command` class
  - adds all nested commands as subcommands via `Command.addSubcommand`

Examples of generated code can be found in the `example` project, within their respective `.g.dart` files.

## Features

### Type-Safe Argument Parsing

#### Supported Types

You can define your command methods with any Dart primitive type or enum, and `cli-gen` will automatically parse the incoming string arguments into the correct type.

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand({
  // Supported types: String, int, double, bool, num, Uri, BigInt, and DateTime
  Uri? outputFile,

  // Enums can automatically be parsed from strings
  MergeStrategy? strategy,

  // Custom types can also be used, but require passing your own
  // String parser to the `@Option` annotation
  @Option(parser: Email.fromString) Email? email,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

#### Collection Types

The Collection types `List`, `Set`, and `Iterable` are also supported, and can be used in combination with any of the above supported types.

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand({
  List<Uri>? inputFiles,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

#### Named and Positional Parameters

`cli_gen` can handle parameters no matter if they're positional or named; you're free to mix and match as you see fit.

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand(
  int? positionalParam, {
  String? namedParam,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

#### Enums and Allowed Values

TODO

### Help Text Inference (--help)

CLI applications typically provide a `--help` option that displays a list of available commands and their parameters, to help users understand how they can interact with the application.

Rather than manually manitaining these details yourself, `cli-gen` automatically generates help text from your annotated methods, based on the method and parameter names, doc comments, default values, and whether each parameter is required or not.

#### Parameter Help Text

```dart
@cliCommand
Future<void> myCustomCommand({
  // Required parameters will be shown to the user as `mandatory`
  required String requiredParam,

  // Optional and/or nullable parameters are not `mandatory`
  int? optionalParam,

  // Default values are also shown in the help text
  String defaultPath = '~/',

  // Use doc comments (i.e. 3 slashes) to display a description of the parameter
  /// A parameter that uses a doc comment
  String someDocumentedParameter,
}) async {
  // ...
}
```

The above Dart function will generate a cli command with the following help text:

```bash
$ myCustomCommand --help
Save your local modifications to a new stash.

Usage: git stash my-custom-command [arguments]
-h, --help                         Print this usage information.
    --required-param (mandatory)
    --optional-param
    --default-path                 (defaults to "~/")
    --some-documented-parameter    A parameter that uses a doc comment

Run "git help" to see global options.
```

#### Command Help Text

You can also generate descriptions for your commands and the entire application by using doc comments on the annotated classes and methods.

```dart
/// A dart implementation of the git CLI.
@cliRunner
class GitRunner extends _$GitRunner {

  /// Merge two or more development histories together.
  @cliCommand
  Future<void> commit() async {
    // ...
  }
}
```

will generate:

```bash
$ git-runner --help
A dart implementation of the git CLI.

Usage: git-runner [arguments]
-h, --help    Print this usage information.

Available commands:
  commit    Merge two or more development histories together.

Run "git help" to see global options.
```

### Name Formatting

`cli-gen` translates Dart class, method and parameter names to kebab-case, which is the convention for CLI commands and flags.

For example, a method named `stashChanges` will be translated to `stash-changes`, and a parameter named `outputFile` will be translated to `--output-file`.

To override the default behavior, simply provide a `name` to the respective annotation (supported for `@cliCommand`, `@cliSubcommand`, `@cliRunner`, and `@Option`).

### Proper Error Handling

TODO

## Design Goals

TODO: write a little blurb about the goals (incl. what `cli-gen` is and what it is not).

## Inspiration

Several projects were researched as references of CLI ergonomics and macro libraries, including:

- [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/) - a declarative CLI parser for Rust
